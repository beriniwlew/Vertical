# Vertical ↑

Some may call it an EMS, ERP, or another term, but Vertical will be called an “Organization Management System”, because it will be for businesses and non-profit organizations alike. 

Version 1.0 of Vertical will be designed for small businesses and organizations that want to manage their record keeping needs, such contact relationships, product information, service offerings, invoicing, payments, expenses, scheduling, employees, and more.     

The software of Vertical, which will be open-source, will be free (as in beer) under the MIT License, so developers and organizations will be free to modify it for their own needs and even resell their own platforms of it to cater to niche markets.

The goal of Vertical is to help small businesses and organizations grow into larger ones, and to create a modular system where industry-specific functionality can be built on top of the core system.
